Start blogging w/ this Simple static blog generator.

***Some features***:

* 82 lines of code.
* ***EASY*** to use. 
  
  *Got fed up of the complexity of `jekyll`, `pelican` and
   other complex softwares for such an easy task.*

## Quick start

***Setup***:

1. Install

        pip3 install stab

2. Clone the source of this site as a base to build upon.

        git clone https://github.com/oxalorg/stab-site

That's it. If you've ever used another static site generator,
this should be enough for you to get startedand build.

If you're still not convinced of how easy this is, head over
to the [docs](docs). I'll be posting a series of concise
articles explaining *everything* ;)
